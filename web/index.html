      happening lately.
      
      <h1>About Bauble</h1>
      <p>
	Bauble is software application to help you (yes you) manage a 
	collection of biodiversity specimens. It is intended 
	to be used by botanic gardens, herbaria, arboreta, etc. to manage
	their collection information. It is a 
	<a href="http://opensource.org">open</a>, 
	<a href="http://www.fsf.org">free</a>, 
	cross-platform alternative to BG-Base and similiar software.
      </p>
      <p>
	It is currently in the early stages of development but you can 
	<a href="#download">download</a> a working version.
      </p>

      </div>
      
      <h1>Goals</h1>
      
      <ul>
	<li>Intuitive - the interface for Bauble is designed to be simple 
	  and elegant but no less functional.</li>
	<li>Extensible - developers and institutions should be able to 
	  extend the application to customize it to their needs.</li>
	<li>Connected - ideally Bauble will easily access relevant 
	  information online, such as connecting to
	  <a href="http://www.gbif.org">GBIF</a> to look up information 
	  on a species.</li>
	<li>more, more, more...</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h1>Features</h1>
      <ul>
	<li>Bauble is free. Bauble is licensed under the 
	  <a href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a> 
	  which means you can download, distribute and change the source 
	  code for Bauble as long as the changes you make are also 
	  licensed under the 
	  <a href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a>.</li>
	<li>Bauble is cross-platform. Bauble supports both Linux and 
	  Windows and could easily be ported to other platforms if 
	  there was interest. </li>
	<li>Bauble supports a wide variety of database backends. It has been 
	  test using <a href="http://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a>,  
	  <a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a>, 
	  <a href="http://postgres.org">Postgres</a>. In theory it will work
	  with 
	  <a href="http://www.sybase.com">Sybase</a>, 
	  <a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org">Firebird/Interbase</a>, and 
	  <a href="http://www.mysql.com/products/maxdb/">SapDB/MaxDB</a>, 
	  Oracle and MSSQL.
	</li>
	
	<!--<li>Most actions in Bauble are based on searches. This allows you 
	    to 
	  quickly and easily access the information you are looking for.  For 
	  example, in the search bar you can enter Maxillaria and Bauble will 
	  display all of species of the genus Maxillaria in your collection.
	</li>-->
	<!--
	<li>When a plant is selected from the search results a side bar will 
	  automatically display links to relevant information about the 
	  selected species as provided by the 
	  <a href="http://www.gbif.org">Global Biodiversity Information 
	    Facility</a>. The information may include links to records from 
	  other institutions, images, distribution maps, identification keys, 
	  and more. (** coming soon)</li>
	-->
	<!--
	<li>
	  Bauble makes it difficult to enter redundant information in the 
	  database. 	  
	</li>
	-->
	<!--
	  Eventually we would like to create user definable filters on types 
	  so that users are restricted to entering information in a particular 
	  format, e.g. accession number can be restricted to a format specific 
	  to the institution.
	  -->
	<li>
	  Did we mention it's free!
	</li>
      </ul>
      
      
      <h1>The future</h1>
      <p>
	Bauble will continue to become more reliable, secure and stable.  We 
	also plan to implement the following features sometime in the future.
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Allow Bauble import and export data in several formation including 
	  ABCD, ITF2, others including the ability to easily share information 
	  with other online database that support protocols such as DiGIR, 
	  BioCASE, etc.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Because Bauble is being developed at 
	  <a href="http://www.belizebotanic.org">Belize Botanic Gardens</a> 
	  it's primary focus is towards botanical collections. With
	  help from others we would like to extend the scope of Bauble to 
	  handle other collection types that might be needed for herbaria,
	  zoos, arboreta, etc.
	</li>
	<li>
	  User rights - We plan on making it possible to define user and 
	  group permission on a Bauble database so that an administrator can
	  easily give different permission to individual users. e.g. Some 
	  people could change data while others could only view it.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Improve the tools - It would be nice to have a good collection of 
	  tools bundled with Bauble that can do a variety of things
	  such as create labels and reports, and ....
	</li>
	<li>
	  Other languages support - make it possible to translate Bauble into 
	  other languages with support for entering non-Latin characters
	</li>
	<li>
	  more...
	</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <ol>
	<li>
	  <strong>Why another collection manager application?</strong>
	  <br/>
	  At <a href="http://www.belizebotanic.org">Belize Botanic Gardens</a> 
	  we felt that the free collection management software was either too 
	  expensive, inadequate or only supported Windows so we decided to 
	  create our own.</li>
	<li>
	  <strong>But why for free?</strong>
	  <br/>
	  We feel that current collection management software is overpriced 
	  especially for small institutions in developing countries.  
	  Biodiversity affects our entire world and everything that relies on 
	  it to live. To help protect such a fragile system the management 
	  of information related to biodiversity should not be restricted.  
	</li>
	<li>
	  <strong>Why are there so many prerequisites for installing this 
	    software?</strong>
	  <br/>
	  On Linux, the platform where the software is developed and primarily 
	  used, the prerequisites tend to come preinstalled. It's more of a 
	  hassle for Windows users (but not much).  We assume that anyone 
	  setting up a new collection database is relatively computer savvy 
	  and that installing the prerequisites won't be too much trouble. In 
	  the future we may bundle SQLObject and an SQLite driver and connector
	  with the software so it works out of the box.</li>
