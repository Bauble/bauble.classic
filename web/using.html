	<h3>
	  Entering Data
	</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
	There are two ways to enter data in Bauble.  One way is from the 
	<em>Insert</em> menu.  The other is by right clicking on one of the 
	results from the search and select <em>Edit</em> or <em>Add...</em>.  
	Both do essentially the same thing but
	by right clicking on a search result and either adding new data or 
	editing existing some of the relevant value may be already filled
	in for you when the editor opens.
      </p>
      <p>
	Prior to 0.5.0 all data entry in Bauble was done by entering the data
	in a spreadsheet like table.  We are now moving over to form like 
	editors which provide the user a richer interface.  So far only the
	accession editor and species editor are using this new format 
	although these are the most complicated of the editors. The others 
	should be soon to follow.

      <a name="searching">
	<h3>
	  Searching
	</h3>   
      </a>
      <p>
	One of the main goals for the design of Bauble was to be able to
	find what you want in your data quickly.  Searching in Bauble
	consists of entering a search string in the entry field just
	below the menu.  Pressing enter or clicking on the <em>Search</em> 
	button should give you the results from your search.	
      </p>
      <p>
	You can be more specific about what you want in your results by
	using search keywords. Below is a list of keywords you can use to make
	your life easier in Bauble and a description of what they mean.
      </p>
      <table>
	<tr>
	  <td>Keywords</td>
	  <td>Description</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>family, fam</td>
	  <td>Search in family field of the the Family table</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>genus, gen</td>
	  <td>Search in the genus field of the Genus table</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>sp</td>
	  <td>Search in the sp field of the Species table</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>accession, acc</td>
	  <td>Search in the acc_id field of the Accessions table</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>location, loc</td>
	  <td>Search in the site field of the Location table</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>donor, don</td>
	  <td>Search in the name field of the Donor table</td>
	</tr>
      </table>
      <p>
	The best way to explain how to use the keywords is by using an example.
	If you type fam=Orchidaceae in the search entry then Bauble will search
	for any family names in the database with the name Orchidaceae in them.
      </p>
      <p>
	When search for something there are a couple of things you should 
	remember.  Some of these may change in the future but for now 
	(as of version 0.3.1) they are correct. 	
      </p>
      <ol>
	<li>Searches are case insensitive.</li>
	<li>To search for something with a space in it you should enclose
	the search string in quotes. e.g. loc="Orchid House"</li>
	<li>You can use the character * to search for everything. 
	e.g. acc=* will give you
	all the accessions.  Be careful when doing a search that will return
	thousands of results like gen=*. It can take a *really* long time
	to load 25,000+ generic names.</li>
      </ol>
    

      <a name="creating_reports">
	<h3>Creating Reports</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
	Though Bauble does have an extremely powerful report/formatting system,
	it doesn't at the moment have a nice user interface for generating
	reports.
      </p>
      <p>
	Bauble dumps the data that you have in your search results to 
	<a href="http://ww3.bgbm.org/abcddocs/FrontPage">Access to Biological 
	  Collection Data (ABCD)</a> XML format, sends the data
	through an XSL processor using the stylesheet of your choice to 
	generate PDF files.  If this doesn't mean anything to you then you 
	are better off avoiding the report system for the moment. Though fully
	functional, the reporting system might require a technical background
	to use at the moment. 
      </p>
      <p>
	If you wish you can play with it from the <em>Tools|Formatter</em>
	menu.
