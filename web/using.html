      <h3>
	<a name="connecting">Connecting to a database</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
	When you start Bauble the first thing that comes up is the
	connection dialog.
      </p>
      <img src="images/screenshots/bauble-closed-conn-dialog-0.7.0.png"
	   alt="connection manager screenshot"/>
      <p>
	Bauble allows you to connect to any existing database. If you
	connect to an empty database or a database not created or
	recognized by Bauble an error dialog will pop up.
      </p>

      <h3>
	<a name="creating">Creating a new database</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
	To create a new database you have to first connect to a
	database.  This can either be done by selecting a filename for
	a SQLite database or by supplying connection parameters to a
	database server (Postgres, MySQL, etc.).  If you need further
	help connecting to a database then see <a
	href="#connecting">Connecting to a database</a>
      </p>

      <p>
	If you are connecting using a SQLite file based database then
	Bauble can handler everything that needs to be done to create
	a new database.  If you are connecting to a server based
	database then you will have to manually create the database
	and permissions for the database while Bauble will create the
	tables and import the default data set.  Creating a database
	on a server based database is beyond the scope of this manual.
	If you just got the chills or sick at your stomach I recommend
	you just stick with SQLite.
      </p>

      <p>
	If you have connected to a database that has not yet been
	initialized by Bauble then you will get the following
	screenshot.  Be careful because if you have entered the wrong
	connection parameters it is possible to overwrite an existing
	database at this connection.
      </p>
      <img src="images/screenshots/bauble-create-new-0.7.png" alt=""/>
      <p>
	If you are sure you want to create a database at this
	connection then select "Yes". Bauble will then start creating
	the database tables and importing the default data. This can
	take a minute or two so be patient.
      </p>
      
      <h3>
	<a name="entering_data">Entering Data</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
	There are two ways to enter data in Bauble.  One way is from
	the <em>Insert</em> menu.  The other is by right clicking on
	one of the results from the search and select <em>Edit</em> or
	<em>Add...</em>.  Both do essentially the same thing but by
	right clicking on a search result and either adding new data
	or editing existing some of the relevant values may be already
	filled in for you when the editor opens.
      </p>

      <h3>
	<a name="searching">Searching</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
	One of the main goals for the design of Bauble was to be able to
	find what you want in your data quickly.  Searching in Bauble
	consists of entering a search string in the entry field just
	below the menu.  Pressing enter or clicking on the <em>Search</em>
	button should give you the results from your search.
      </p>
      <p>
	You can be more specific about what you want in your results by
	using search keywords. Below is a list of keywords you can use to make
	your life easier in Bauble and a description of what they mean.
      </p>
      <table>
	<tr>
	  <td>Keywords</td>
	  <td>Description</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>family, fam</td>
	  <td>Search in family field of the the Family table</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>genus, gen</td>
	  <td>Search in the genus field of the Genus table</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>sp</td>
	  <td>Search in the sp field of the Species table</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>accession, acc</td>
	  <td>Search in the clode field of the Accessions table</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>plant</td>
	  <td>Search for an accession code combined with a plant code</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>location, loc</td>
	  <td>Search in the site field of the Location table</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>donor, don</td>
	  <td>Search in the name field of the Donor table</td>
	</tr>
      </table>
      <p>
	The best way to explain how to use the keywords is by using an example.
	If you type fam=Orchidaceae in the search entry then Bauble will search
	for any family names in the database with the name Orchidaceae in them.
      </p>
      <p>
	When searching for something there are a couple of things you should
	remember.  Some of these may change in the future but for now
	(as of version 0.7.0) they are correct.
      </p>
      <ol>
	<li>Searches are case insensitive.</li>
	<li>To search for something with a space in it you should enclose
	the search string in quotes. e.g. loc="Orchid House"</li>
	<li>You can use the character * to search for everything.
	e.g. acc=* will give you
	all the accessions.  Be careful when doing a search that will return
	thousands of results like gen=*. It can take a *really* long time
	to load 25,000+ generic names.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Advanced searching</h4>
      <p>
	It is possible to do more advanced searches in Bauble but these
	usually require a better understanding of the tables and table
	columns in the database. For example the query:</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 2em">
	<em >plant where accession.species.genus.genus=Ptychosperma and
	location.site="Block 14"</em> 
	</p>
	<p>would return all of the plants whose genus is Ptychosperma and are located in "Block 14".  
      </p>

      <h3>
	<a name="creating_reports">Creating Reports</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
	Though Bauble does have an extremely powerful report/formatting system,
	it doesn't at the moment have a nice user interface for generating
	reports.
      </p>
      <p>
	Bauble dumps the data that you have in your search results to
	<a href="http://ww3.bgbm.org/abcddocs/FrontPage">Access to
	Biological Collection Data (ABCD)</a> XML format, sends the
	data through an XSL processor using the stylesheet of your
	choice to generate PDF files.  If this doesn't mean anything
	to you then you are better off avoiding the report system for
	the moment. Though fully functional, to use the reporting system
	would most likely require a technical background.
      </p>
      <p>
	If you wish you can play with it from the <em>Tools|Formatter</em>
	menu.
