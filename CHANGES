2005.10.28
----------
- still doing some work on external editors, still broken but closer

2005.10.27
----------
- got external editors working for SingleJoins, its far from perfect yet but its 
a first pass, e.g. right now you can create species_meta for a species table
but you can't edit it later
- external editors can now signal that changes were made so the dirty flag can
be properly set on the editor
- commited r111
- update species_infobox to reflect species meta

2005.10.25
----------
- changed Plantnames to Species 
- added a SpeciesMeta table to hold extra information about a species such
as distribution and created an SpeciesMetaEditor


2005.10.23
----------
- more work on XSL formatter plugin, should work now


2005.10.21
----------
- canged preferences to use python's ConfigParse with a dict interfase, the 
prefs API should be the same as before but the config file format is no longer 
compatible, the new format uses an ini type syntax
- added a generic XSL formatter plugin, though not finished yet
- moved main_is_frozen to bauble.__init__.py


2005.10.15
----------
- fixes in latitude/longitude handling in the CollectionEditor dialog as well
as in the Collection infobox
- ** dates still don't work in the CollectionEditor
- removed Plantname.supfam,subgen and subgen_rank
- got the great idea to create a 'CHANGES' files and added to version control
- see revision 106 for other things for the day
