i'm an idiot
- tweaks to the example xsl stylesheet in the formatter plugin 
(labels.xsl, larger_label.xsl)
- removed all signs of threading code, there's no going back

one

2005.12.28
----------
- fixed datetime issues with the CollectionEditor
- change TreeViewEditorDialog.commit_changes again to just iterate of the model
in the view and call _transform_row on each row in the model instead of 
calling _set_value_from_widgets in start()
- if everything doesn't get successfully committed in a TreeViewEditorDialog
then desensitize those rows that were committed correctly and reshow the dialog
- removed 'Preferences' from the Edit menu until we get some preferences tabs

2005.11.3
----------
- fixed completion bug so that the selected value is inserted into the proper 
row


2005.11.2
----------
- editors should be fixed for the most part but i'm sure they still need some
polish
- invoking an editor inside an editor to edit a single join work now
- editors now set sqlhub.processConnection to the editors transaction so that
all operations that happend while something is being edited can be rolled 
backed, this doesn't seem to cause any problems and is the best way to keep 
from getting straggling data such as collection data not associated with 
an accession
- need alot of API cleanup
- commited r114
- remove TableEditorDialog, i don't think its really a useful abstraction
- alot of code cleanup and removing debugging code and old irrelevant stuff
- committed r115
- just before i committed i noticed that there's a problem with editing
multiple values in a treevieweditor dialog with completion, it seems that
only the first row gets set no matter which row is being edited
- there also seem to be a problem with the accession editor that causes it to
randomly crash, usually when entering the species name


2005.11.1
----------
- editors now take keyword argument connection


2005.10.29
----------

----------
- still doing some work on external editors, still broken but closer


2005.10.27
----------
- got external editors working for SingleJoins, its far from perfect yet but its 
a first pass, e.g. right now you can create species_meta for a species table
but you can't edit it later
- external editors can now signal that changes were made so the dirty flag can
be properly set on the editor
- commited r111
- update species_infobox to reflect species meta

2005.10.25
----------
- changed Plantnames to Species 
- added a SpeciesMeta table to hold extra information about a species such
as distribution and created an SpeciesMetaEditor


2005.10.23
----------
- more work on XSL formatter plugin, should work now


2005.10.21
----------
- canged preferences to use python's ConfigParse with a dict interfase, the 
prefs API should be the same as before but the config file format is no longer 
compatible, the new format uses an ini type syntax
