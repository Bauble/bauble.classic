2005.11.2
----------
- editors should be fixed for the most part but i'm sure they still need some
polish
- invoking an editor inside an editor to edit a single join work now
- editors now set sqlhub.processConnection to the editors transaction so that
all operations that happend while something is being edited can be rolled 
backed, this doesn't seem to cause any problems and is the best way to keep 
from getting straggling data such as collection data not associated with 
an accession
- need alot of API cleanup


2005.11.1
----------
- editors now take keyword argument connection

2005.10.29
----------
- the editor start method no longer commits your changes, whoever invokes
the editor is responsible or commiting the changes
- tried to simplify TreeViewEditorDialog.commit_changes
- the editing the single joins are broken at the moment

2005.10.28
----------
- still doing some work on external editors, still broken but closer

2005.10.27
----------
- got external editors working for SingleJoins, its far from perfect yet but its 
a first pass, e.g. right now you can create species_meta for a species table
but you can't edit it later
- external editors can now signal that changes were made so the dirty flag can
be properly set on the editor
- commited r111
- update species_infobox to reflect species meta

2005.10.25
----------
- changed Plantnames to Species 
- added a SpeciesMeta table to hold extra information about a species such
as distribution and created an SpeciesMetaEditor


2005.10.23
----------
- more work on XSL formatter plugin, should work now


2005.10.21
----------
- canged preferences to use python's ConfigParse with a dict interfase, the 
prefs API should be the same as before but the config file format is no longer 
compatible, the new format uses an ini type syntax
- added a generic XSL formatter plugin, though not finished yet
- moved main_is_frozen to bauble.__init__.py


2005.10.15
----------
- fixes in latitude/longitude handling in the CollectionEditor dialog as well
as in the Collection infobox
- ** dates still don't work in the CollectionEditor
- removed Plantname.supfam,subgen and subgen_rank
- got the great idea to create a 'CHANGES' files and added to version control
- see revision 106 for other things for the day
