----------
release 0.5.2

2006.06.25
----------
- pass species correctly accession editor when opened from the species editor
- fixes for windows
- set app busy when creating a new database, this doesn't work very well since
the gui isn't given time to update and csv import doesn't block
- now get plants from family and genera in results 
- make sure that the plants in the formatter list are unique
- other minor improvements to formatter plugin and documentation updates

2006.06.24
----------
- on going doc improvements
- improved speed of editor.SQLObjectProxy by doing less attribute lookups
in some methods

- show a message and don't let the use open the accession or species editor
unless species or genera already exist in the database
- forgot to change GenusSynonyms.txt to new imex_csv format
- change Family.family to not be alternateID so we can have both, 
e.g., Malvaceae (s. lat) and Malvaceae (s. str), this is a bit of a fuck
up since it changes the model so it should require us to bump the minor
number and recreate the database if you want this feature
- other small bugs in imex_csv and the utils message_dialog

2006.06.12
----------
- changed the format of csv import to now use the column names as they are in
the database instead of how SQLObject sees them
- changed the way dialogs are show in csv import to prevent lock ups
- tried to improve the speed of imports a bit by changing the way the rows
are inserted, we now use sqlobject.sqlbuild.Insert. though it would still probably
be faster if we got it to work by sending the entire list of values to the 
insert instead of one row at i time, i'm not sure if this is the real bottleneck
on the imports

sensitive and changing the color of the species entry

----------
- added validator support to GenericEditorPresenter.assign_simple_handler()

version number
- small fixes on the accession infobox

----------
- added validator support to GenericEditorPresenter.assign_simple_handler()

shouldn't change anything in the database but could cause problems if using an

polish
- invoking an editor inside an editor to edit a single join work now
- editors now set sqlhub.processConnection to the editors transaction so that
all operations that happend while something is being edited can be rolled

from getting straggling data such as collection data not associated with 
an accession

- alot of code cleanup and removing debugging code and old irrelevant stuff

multiple values in a treevieweditor dialog with completion, it seems that
only the first row gets set no matter which row is being edited

randomly crash, usually when entering the species name


2005.11.1

a first pass, e.g. right now you can create species_meta for a species table
but you can't edit it later
- external editors can now signal that changes were made so the dirty flag can
be properly set on the editor
- commited r111
- update species_infobox to reflect species meta

2005.10.25

- added a SpeciesMeta table to hold extra information about a species such
as distribution and created an SpeciesMetaEditor


2005.10.23
----------
- more work on XSL formatter plugin, should work now


2005.10.21
----------
- canged preferences to use python's ConfigParse with a dict interfase, the 
prefs API should be the same as before but the config file format is no longer
