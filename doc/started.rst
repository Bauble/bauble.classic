Connecting to a database
========================

When you start Bauble the first thing that comes up is the connection dialog. 

.. image:: images/screenshots/bauble-closed-conn-dialog.png

From this dialog you can select the different connection parameters.

If this is the first time that you are starting Bauble then you will
not having any connections to choose from.  Click on the add button to
create a new connection.

If you plan to associate pictures to plants, specify also the *pictures
root* folder. This is explained in further detail in the Plants section.

By default Bauble uses the file-based SQLite database.  If you use the
default filename then Bauble creates a database file with the same name as
the connection in ``~/.bauble`` on Linux/MacOSX or in
``AppData\Roaming\Bauble`` on Windows.

Bauble allows you to connect to any existing database. If you connect to an
empty database a message will popup asking asking you if you would like to
inizialize it as a new database.

If you are connecting to an existing database you can continue to Inserting
or Searching, otherwise read on to the following section.

Creating a new database
=======================

To inizialize a database you have to first connect to a database. See
:ref:`connecting`.

If you are connecting using the default SQLite database backend then Bauble
can handle everything that needs to be done to create a database that Bauble
will then initialize.

If you are connecting to a server based database like `PostgreSQL
<http://www.postgresql.org>`_ will have to manually create the database,
user and permissions for the database while Bauble will create the tables
and import the default data set.  Creating a database on a server based
database is beyond the scope of this manual. If you just got the chills or
sick at your stomach I recommend you just stick with SQLite.

If you have connected to a database that has not yet been initialized
by Bauble then you will get the following dialog\: 

.. image:: images/screenshots/bauble-create-new.png

Be careful because if you have entered the wrong connection parameters
it is possible to overwrite an existing database at this connection.

If you are sure you want to create a database at this connection then
select "Yes". Bauble will then start creating the database tables and
importing the default data. This can take a minute or two so while all
of the default data is imported into the database so be patient.

Once the default database has been created then you are ready to start
inserting and subsequently searching...
