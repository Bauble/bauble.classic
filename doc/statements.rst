Who is behind Bauble
..............................................

Bauble started as a one-man project, by Brett Adams. He wrote Bauble for the
Belize Botanical Garden, and later on adapted it for a couple of other users
who asked him to use it. Brett made Bauble a commons, by releasing it under
a GPL license.

After years of stagnation Mario Frasca took responsibility of updating
Bauble, and it is now Mario Frasca writing this, enhancing the software,
looking for users, requesting feedback...

So currently behind Bauble there's again one developer, but much more
importantly, a small but growing global users community.

Translations are provided by volunteers who mostly stay behind the scenes,
translating a couple of missing terms or sentences, and disappearing again.
