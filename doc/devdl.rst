Downloading the source
======================

The Bauble source can be downloaded from our source
repository on `github <http://github.com/Bauble/bauble.classic>`_.

If you want a particular version of Bauble, we release and maintain versions
into branches. you should ``git checkout`` the branch corresponding to the
version of your choice. Branch names for Bauble versions are of the form
``bauble-x.y``, where x.y can be 1.0, for example. Our workflow is to commit
to the `master` development branch or to a `patch` branch and to include the
commits into a `release` branch when ready.

To check out the most recent code from the source repository you will need
to install the `Git <http://www.git.org>`_ version control system. Git is
incuded in all reasonable Linux distributions and can be installed on all
current operating systems.

Once you have installed Git you can checkout the latest Bauble code with
the following command::

        git clone https://github.com/Bauble/bauble.classic.git
