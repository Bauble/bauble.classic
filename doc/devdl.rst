Downloading the source
======================

The Bauble source can be downloaded from our source
repository on `github <http://github.com/mfrasca/bauble.classic>`_.

We do not currently `release` a specially quality checked Bauble version,
all of our commits to the Master branch are equally quality checked.

To check out the most recent code from the source repository you will need
to install the `Git <http://www.git.org>`_ version control system. Git is
incuded in all reasonable Linux distributions and can be installed on all
current operating systems.

Once you have installed Git you can checkout the latest Bauble code with
the following command::

        git clone https://github.com/mfrasca/bauble.classic.git
