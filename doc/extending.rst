Extending Bauble with Plugins
-----------------------------

Nearly everything about Bauble is extensible through plugins. Plugins
can create tables, define custom searchs, add menu items, create
custom commands and more.

To create a new plugin you must extend the ``bauble.pluginmgr.Plugin``
class.
