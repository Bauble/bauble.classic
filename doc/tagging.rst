Tagging
-------

Tagging is an easy way to give context to an object or create a
collection of object that you want to recall later. For example if you
want to collect a bunch of plants that you later want to create a
report from you can tag them with the string "for that report i was
thinking about". You can then select "for that report i was thinking
about" from the tags menu to show you all the objects you tagged.

Tagging can be done two ways. By selecting one or more items in the
search results and pressing Ctrl-T or by selecting
:menuselection:`Tag-->Tag Selection` from the menu. If you have
selected multiple items then only that tags that are common to all the
selected items will have a check next to it.
